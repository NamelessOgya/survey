# aim  
- Describe the process of moving from experimentation to production.
- Describe the phases of building a machine learning model for production
- Explain the tools you’ll need to interact with Vertex AI as you move from experimentation to production.
# introduction  
# Moving from experimentation to production  
- typical ML development during experimentation  
  - what to do
    - Framing the problem
    - prepare training data
    - experimenting
    - evaluating the model
  - experiment environment is various
    - different architecture
    - different input data set
    - different hyperparameters
    - different hardware
- moving from experimentation to production  
  - requeires...
    - package
    - deploy
    - monitor
- what is there to unify  
  - dataset is 
    - created
    - ingested
    - analyzed
    - cleaned
  - model is
    - trained
    - versioned
    - evaluated
    - deployed
