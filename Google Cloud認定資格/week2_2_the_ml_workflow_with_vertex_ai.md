# Week2_1   
## intro  
## Datapreparation  
- featurestore
  - feature are shareble for train nad serving
  - reusable
  - scaleble
  - easy to use

## model training  
## model evaluation  
## model serving  
two steps  
  - model deploy
  - model monitoring  
  
MLOps  
  - building an integrated ML system
  - operating it in production
  - advocating for automation and monitoring at each step of ml system construction  
    -  CI
    -  CT(continuous training)
    -  CD

1. model deployment  
    - endpoint  
    - batch prediction
    - offline prediction
2. monitoring  
    - pipelines
      - automate
      - monitor
      - govern
